<h1>Are computers microwaves??</h1><br>
  <h3>What do they do?</h3>
  <p>Alright look, so microwaves cook your food and computers do a ton of stuff such as search things up and websites and otehr things, even this website that you are looking at is on a computer and if not then get off your phone.. it's not <em>right</em> to read a website on a phone.. 
    <br>it just <strong><em>isn't<em></strong>
    <br>So by now you still think that computers can literally kill all of humanity <strong><em>twice..</em></strong><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/kdFKwmwADglUorwrIa" width="100" height="120" frameBorder="2" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></p>
    <br>
    <p>So there may be a huge difference between the two but by the end <strong>I WILL</strong> convince you that <em>microwaves</em> and <em>computers</em> are the exact same.</p>
